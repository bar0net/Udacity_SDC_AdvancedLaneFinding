# Udacity_SDC_AdvancedLaneFinding
Advanced Lane Finding - Udacity's Self-Driving Car Nanodegree Project
Implementation by Jordi Tudela Alc√†cer

Built an advanced lane-finding algorithm using distortion correction, image rectification, color transforms, and gradient thresholding. Identified lane curvature and vehicle displacement. Overcame environmental challenges such as shadows and pavement changes.
